# MeetingBuddy [Work in Progress]
MeetingBuddy is a JavaScript app that allows users to join virtual meetings automatically based on their calendar data. The app automatically joins a virtual meeting 5 minutes prior to the scheduled time. MeetingBuddy is currently only Google-based and is compatible with Google Calendar and Google Meet.
